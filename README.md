## Getting Started

First install project dependencies using either `yarn` or `npm install`

Then to run the project, simply use either `yarn start` or `npm start`

Your default browser should automatically open once Webpack finishes building. The project is set up to automatically watch for changes and should refresh the page as necessary.

To build a production bundle, run `yarn run build` or `npm run build`

After Webpack finishes bundling, output files will be in the `dist` folder.
